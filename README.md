### Welcome, travellers!

# Warcraft II: The Stolen Artifacts

Warcraft II: The Stolen Artifacts is an expansion that derives from the videogame Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness. The game is set after the events of Tides of Darkness, in which a small group of the Azeroth's army must expedition to a now destroyed Draenor to find the legendary alliance expeditioners that became trapped in Draenor, and defeat the evil Ner’zhul, by retrieving one of the four artifacts that he stole from Azeroth.

The player must command this expedition in an RTS dungeon crawler game in which they must recover the remaints of that legendary expedition in order to defeat Ner’zhul. Every time the expedition enters Draenor the construction of the land, and the path they will have to take will be different, so the game will be different every run the player makes.
