## Create new Sprite Prisoner: Alleria

## Create Alleria 8 directions
At the beginning, we had the intention that you could play prisoners. That's the reason that I have made her respective animations.

## Create Sprite Artifacts
Sprites artifacts used as a prize system for the player.

## Create new spritesheets
Do spritesheets again in Aseprite to organize them and have their coordinates .json. You can find them [here](https://github.com/DevCrumbs/Warcraft-II/tree/Develompent/Warcraft%20II/Game/data/assets/textures/units) . Those that are modified have written in front Final.

## Fix visual animations
Fix the sprite coordinates wrong placed in the game.

## UI Start Screen
### Ner'zhul
I draw from zero the character of the main screen with his animation.

### Parchment
The parchment that represents the main screen menu.

### Background

## Goldmine and Runestone used Sprite
To improve player's understanding, I drew sprites representing constructions when they can no longer be used because they are previously used.
